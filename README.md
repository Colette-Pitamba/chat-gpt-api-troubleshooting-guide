# Troubleshoot Guide: Chat GPT API

## API key not working
- Make sure you have copied the API key correctly and that it matches the one in your OpenAI account dashboard.
- Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces.
- Ensure that your API key is still active and has not expired. You can check the status of your API key in your OpenAI account dashboard.
- Check that you have not exceeded the rate limit for your API key - If you have made too many requests within a certain time period, your key may be temporarily suspended.
- You can regenerate a new API key from the OpenAI dashboard.
- If none of the above solutions work, contact OpenAI support for assistance.

## Code not running properly
- Ensure that you have correctly installed all the necessary dependencies, libraries, and modules.
- Double-check that you have not missed any code blocks or syntax errors, and that you have the correct version of the code.
- Make sure you have followed the instructions in the correct order and that you have all the required permissions and access.

## Rate limit exceeded
- The Chat GPT API has a limit on the number of requests you can make in a certain period - If you exceed the limit, you will receive this error message. Wait for a few minutes and try again.
- You can also consider upgrading your plan to get a higher request limit.

## Connection errors

- Check if there are any firewalls, proxies, or security software that may be blocking your connection.

- Check the API documentation for common error messages and their solutions.
- Ensure that the input is valid and properly formatted.
- Verify that the API key has the necessary permissions to access the Chat GPT API.
